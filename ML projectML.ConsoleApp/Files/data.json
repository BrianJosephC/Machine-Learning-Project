Yes, loading in the beginning takes time and the music is shitty, but I have never had a problem with the game crashing."], ["I would disagree with nearly all of your points. Most of them seem to be subjective anyways.\n\nThe Crew 2 is a great beginner game for people looking to get into racing games. It's got a simple interface, basic things to do, and a pretty good range of cars, bikes, boats, and planes. As someone who's only played the 2005 NFS Most Wanted, it was a great reintroduction for me into the more modern racing games.\n\nYou can get a good 80-90 hours of playtime if you do all the races and try all the race styles equally, instead of just doing the street races and hypercar races. Personally, I've found Drift events, Rally Cross events, and the boat races really fun.\n\nThe only things I would say against this game are the shitty AI and the lack of component customisation. The AI is super unfair, unless you're a lot of levels above them. I've found AI cars crashing into me and blocking me so frequently that I gave up the game for a bit. Additionally, you can't really change engine parts, or wheel parts like tires etc, or transmissions, etc. You DO have a lot of cosmetic customisation, and most of it is really really well done.\n\nThe biggest turn off is the lack of content beyond a certain point. I've played about 110 hours, and beyond about 90 hours, you'll only enjoy if you hqve friends to play with, or you're super into the weekly things. PvP is quite sparse, and it's full of people who enjoy ramming your car off track instead of driving cleanly."], ["The crew 2 is trash for me too, the car driving is absolutely awful compared to other racing games such as nfs or forza"], ["HEY!

The crew 2 took an even bigger dump on driving physics imo and I found it unplayable, in fact I stopped playing and didn\u2019t even make it through the story. The world felt worse somehow, even though it was the same overall map as the first one. I genuinely couldn\u2019t find enjoyment in this game which is a shame as it looks like they\u2019ve supported it well with vehicles and game modes, but I have no intention of going back to it. I haven\u2019t tried Heat yet as I\u2019m waiting for it to hit game pass next week but every recent NFS game up till now has also just been bad.

I would have no issue with that, that's what endgame honestly is in most games, but most games actually do something with updates. If the updates actually introduced something new, I'd have no issue, but they don't. All of those \"updates\" to the game? There's nothing. You're going to do something you did for 40 hours before. There is zero creativity, just useless content fluff; filler. Same with The Division, same with The Crew. Riders Republic is going to have the exact same situation. I guarantee it. Just continous non-update updates.\n\nI have genuinely not seen a developer be so cowardly about doing even anything *remotely* unique or different in an update as Ubisoft. Complete these races, complete these events, collect these points, just ad naseum every update. Oh but now you can do all of that in this *new* shiny car!!!\n\nHow do people continue to be interested in these games?\n\nThe only thing I'll give them are the additional disciplines that they've added in updates, but they would be so monumentally difficult to implement in an update just like that, that there's no way in hell these were not planned from the start."], ["I played it on a free weekend once after i liked to screw around on the crew 1 for a while since it was free. \n\nI didnt care for it.

You can look up which races/events give you the most money for the shortest amount of race time and essentially memorize those races. Like someone else said, it\u2019s a pretty good entry level/beginner racing game. The graphics are decent imo, but that definitely depends on your GPU. I haven\u2019t played The Crew, so I can\u2019t compare it to #2. However, I don\u2019t think The Crew 2 is necessarily a bad purchase given it\u2019s only like $10-$15 on the uplay store.

You can\u2019t find old vehicles lying around anymore, fast travel between cities is severely limited, and many of the great mini games from the first game simply aren\u2019t there anymore.

I just think that it's a good game to introduce people to more serious racing games. The events and races are laid out very clearly, you know what you've done and what you still have to do, and you can even test drive vehicles. I feel like the biggest comparision done for this game is with Forza Horizon 4, and while that game is definitely better, it's also much more complex for a newer player. As someone who played FH4 after playing TC2, I was a bit lost while trying to figure out which races I could and couldn't do, and what difference the parts swapping made other than the visible class changes from D all the way to X.

I don't live in America myself but all the building looked kinda similar. Some of the cities felt like they have no life in them and I was just not excited about that. Of course I didn't expect the whole america to be on a 1 to 1 atomic scale but I expected more quality than quality. Anyway I didn't buy the game. I thought of getting it because I love the street racing genre but I guess I will stick with need for speed (am on ps4 btw).

That\u2019s why it hurts so much that the second one was actually a step backwards when I was so excited for it.
